# mantraUSD Documentation

Documentation site for mantraUSD, an ecosystem stablecoin built on M0's universal stablecoin platform.

## Overview

mantraUSD is an ecosystem stablecoin built on **M0's universal stablecoin platform**, designed to become the primary medium of exchange for tokenized Real World Assets (RWAs). As an extension of **$M** (M0's base stablecoin), mantraUSD inherits M0's security and operational framework. M0 is the same building block used by several of the largest stablecoins (e.g., mUSD), and **all collateralization is handled by M0**. This documentation site provides comprehensive technical information, integration guides, and resources for developers and users.
