title: Minting & Burning
---

## Overview

mantraUSD operates as an extension of **$M** (M0's base stablecoin). All minting and burning operations leverage M0's infrastructure, where M-denominated assets are locked on Ethereum and mantraUSD tokens are minted on MANTRA Chain via bridge technologies.

## Minting mantraUSD

Minting creates new mantraUSD tokens through M0's collateral system. All collateralization is handled by M0, which manages the underlying U.S. Treasury Bills that back mantraUSD.

### How Minting Works

1. **M0 Collateral Deposit**: User deposits are transformed into short-dated U.S. Treasury Bills via SPVs managed by M0
2. **M-denominated Asset Lock**: M-denominated assets are locked on Ethereum through M0 Core Protocol
3. **Cross-Chain Bridge**: Bridge technology (including Wormhole) enables cross-chain transfer
4. **mantraUSD Minting**: mantraUSD tokens are minted on MANTRA Chain
5. **Validator Attestation**: Validator nodes ensure continuous backing for all circulating supply

### Minting Process

```
User Deposit → M0 Protocol → U.S. Treasury Bills (SPVs) → M Locked on Ethereum → Bridge → mantraUSD Minted on MANTRA Chain
```

### Mint Ratio

The M0 Core Protocol maintains a **mint ratio** (safety factor >1) that ensures over-collateralization:
- All mantraUSD supply is fully backed by U.S. Treasury collateral
- The system maintains collateral value greater than total supply
- Validators continuously monitor and attest to backing

<Info>
  The M0 Core Protocol ensures all tokens minted are always fully backed and redeemable at par. View real-time data on the [mantraUSD Dashboard](https://dashboard.m0.org/stablecoins/mantrausd).

## Burning mantraUSD

Burning destroys mantraUSD tokens to redeem the underlying collateral managed by M0.

### How Burning Works

1. **Burn Tokens**: Send mantraUSD tokens to be burned on MANTRA Chain
2. **Bridge Unlock**: Bridge technology unlocks corresponding M-denominated assets on Ethereum
3. **M0 Redemption**: M0 handles redemption of underlying U.S. Treasury collateral
4. **Settlement**: Redemptions follow T+2 settlement timelines (consistent with U.S. Treasury market operations)

### Burning Process

```
mantraUSD Burn on MANTRA Chain → Bridge → M Unlocked on Ethereum → M0 Redemption → Collateral Settlement (T+2)
```

### Redemption Access

- **Direct Redemptions**: Available to authorized Minters meeting KYC/AML and compliance requirements
- **Secondary Markets**: Most holders rely on secondary markets for liquidity
- **Settlement Timeline**: T+2 settlement consistent with U.S. Treasury market operations

<Warning>
  Direct redemptions are generally available only to authorized institutional participants. Most users must rely on secondary markets where liquidity and pricing are not guaranteed.
</Warning>

## M0 Infrastructure

All minting and burning operations rely on M0's infrastructure:

- **M0 Core Protocol**: Ensures all tokens are fully backed and redeemable at par
- **Collateral Management**: M0 manages all U.S. Treasury collateral in SPVs
- **Validator Network**: Continuous monitoring and attestation of collateral
- **Bridge Technology**: Secure cross-chain asset transfers

## Fees and Costs

Minting and burning may involve:

- **M0 Protocol Fees**: Fees associated with M0's minting and redemption operations
- **Bridge Fees**: Costs for cross-chain transfers
- **Gas Fees**: Network transaction fees (paid in native tokens)
- **Settlement Costs**: Associated with T+2 Treasury market settlement

<Info>
  Fee structures are determined by M0 and bridge providers. Check current fee schedules before minting or burning.
