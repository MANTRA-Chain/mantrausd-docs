title: How mantraUSD Works
---

## Overview

mantraUSD is an ecosystem stablecoin built on **M0's universal stablecoin platform**, designed to become the primary medium of exchange for tokenized Real World Assets (RWAs). As an extension of **$M** (M0's base stablecoin), mantraUSD inherits M0's security and operational framework while introducing targeted reward redistribution to ecosystem partners.

## Core Architecture

mantraUSD operates through a cross-chain architecture where:
- **M-denominated assets** are locked on Ethereum through the M0 Core Protocol
- **mantraUSD tokens** are minted on MANTRA Chain via bridge technologies
- **All collateralization** is handled by M0, the leading stablecoin provider

## M0 Foundation

mantraUSD leverages M0's battle-tested infrastructure:

- **M0 Core Protocol**: Ensures all tokens minted through the protocol are always fully backed and redeemable at par
- **Collateral Management**: All collateral operations are handled by M0's system
- **Security Framework**: Inherits M0's security and operational best practices
- **Validator Network**: Continuous monitoring and attestation of collateral existence and compliance

<Info>
  mantraUSD relies on the infrastructure of M0. For detailed technical information about the M0 protocol, refer to the [M0 documentation](https://docs.m0.org).

## How It Works

### 1. Collateral Backing

All mantraUSD supply is backed by **short-dated U.S. Treasury Bills** (≤180 days) held in segregated Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) accounts with regulated custodians. This collateral is managed entirely by M0's infrastructure.

### 2. Cross-Chain Minting

When users mint mantraUSD:
1. M-denominated assets are locked on Ethereum through M0 Core Protocol
2. mantraUSD tokens are minted on MANTRA Chain via bridge technologies
3. M0 ensures the underlying collateral fully backs all circulating supply

### 3. Redemption Process

Users can redeem mantraUSD for underlying collateral:
- Redemptions follow T+2 settlement timelines (consistent with U.S. Treasury market operations)
- M0 handles all redemption operations and collateral management
- Direct redemptions are available to authorized Minters meeting KYC/AML requirements

## Key Components

### M0 Core Protocol

The foundation that ensures:
- All tokens are fully backed by eligible collateral
- Continuous validator monitoring and attestation
- Daily mark-to-market pricing updates
- Over-collateralization safety factors (mint ratio >1)

### Bridge Infrastructure

Cross-chain technology (including Wormhole) that enables:
- Locking M-denominated assets on Ethereum
- Minting mantraUSD on MANTRA Chain
- Secure asset transfers between chains

### Yield Distribution

The YieldToOne mechanism that:
- Captures U.S. Treasury yield from underlying collateral
- Distributes rewards to ecosystem partners
- Creates sustainable incentives without token inflation
