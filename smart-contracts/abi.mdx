## Application Binary Interface (ABI)

The ABI defines how to interact with the mantraUSD smart contract. This page provides the contract interface and function signatures.

## Contract Address

**Address:** `0xd2b95283011E47257917770D28Bb3EE44c849f6F`

[View on Blockscout](https://blockscout.mantrascan.io/address/0xd2b95283011E47257917770D28Bb3EE44c849f6F?tab=contract_code)

## Standard ERC-20 Functions

### balanceOf

Get the token balance of an address.

```solidity
function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256)
```

**Parameters:**
- `account` (address): The address to query

**Returns:**
- `uint256`: The token balance

### totalSupply

Get the total supply of mantraUSD tokens.

```solidity
function totalSupply() external view returns (uint256)
```

**Returns:**
- `uint256`: The total token supply

### transfer

Transfer tokens to another address.

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool)
```

**Parameters:**
- `to` (address): The recipient address
- `amount` (uint256): The amount to transfer

**Returns:**
- `bool`: Success status

### approve

Approve another address to spend tokens on your behalf.

```solidity
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool)
```

**Parameters:**
- `spender` (address): The address authorized to spend
- `amount` (uint256): The maximum amount that can be spent

**Returns:**
- `bool`: Success status

### transferFrom

Transfer tokens from one address to another (requires approval).

```solidity
function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool)
```

**Parameters:**
- `from` (address): The sender address
- `to` (address): The recipient address
- `amount` (uint256): The amount to transfer

**Returns:**
- `bool`: Success status

### allowance

Check the amount of tokens a spender is allowed to spend.

```solidity
function allowance(address owner, address spender) external view returns (uint256)
```

**Parameters:**
- `owner` (address): The token owner address
- `spender` (address): The spender address

**Returns:**
- `uint256`: The approved amount

## Events

### Transfer

Emitted when tokens are transferred.

```solidity
event Transfer(address indexed from, address indexed to, uint256 value)
```

### Approval

Emitted when an approval is set.

```solidity
event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 value)
```

## Custom Functions

<Info>
  The exact custom functions depend on the contract implementation. Check the verified contract source code on Blockscout for the complete ABI, or refer to the contract documentation.

## Getting the Full ABI

To get the complete ABI:

1. Visit the contract on [Blockscout](https://blockscout.mantrascan.io/address/0xd2b95283011E47257917770D28Bb3EE44c849f6F?tab=contract_code)
2. Navigate to the "Contract" tab
3. Copy the ABI from the verified contract source

## Usage Examples

### Check Balance

```javascript
const contract = new ethers.Contract(
  '0xd2b95283011E47257917770D28Bb3EE44c849f6F',
  abi,
  provider
);

const balance = await contract.balanceOf(userAddress);
console.log('Balance:', ethers.utils.formatEther(balance));
```

### Transfer Tokens

```javascript
const signer = provider.getSigner();
const contract = new ethers.Contract(
  '0xd2b95283011E47257917770D28Bb3EE44c849f6F',
  abi,
  signer
);

const tx = await contract.transfer(recipientAddress, amount);
await tx.wait();
```
