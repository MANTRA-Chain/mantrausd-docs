## General Questions

### What is mantraUSD?

mantraUSD is an ecosystem stablecoin built on **M0's universal stablecoin platform**, designed to become the primary medium of exchange for tokenized Real World Assets (RWAs). As an extension of **$M** (M0's base stablecoin), mantraUSD inherits M0's security and operational framework. M0 is the same building block used by several of the largest stablecoins (e.g., mUSD), and **all collateralization is handled by M0**.

### What is the contract address?

The mantraUSD smart contract address is:

**`0xd2b95283011E47257917770D28Bb3EE44c849f6F`**

You can view it on [Blockscout](https://blockscout.mantrascan.io/address/0xd2b95283011E47257917770D28Bb3EE44c849f6F?tab=contract_code).

### How is mantraUSD different from other stablecoins?

mantraUSD is specifically designed as the ecosystem stablecoin for the MANTRA ecosystem, built on M0's universal stablecoin platform. Unlike first-generation stablecoins that extract value, mantraUSD distributes rewards derived from U.S. Treasury yield to ecosystem partners who drive adoption. It's an extension of $M from M0, leveraging the same battle-tested infrastructure used by major stablecoins like mUSD.

### Is mantraUSD backed by collateral?

Yes, mantraUSD is fully backed by **short-dated U.S. Treasury Bills** (≤180 days). **All collateralization is handled by M0**, the leading stablecoin provider. The collateral is held in segregated Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) accounts with regulated custodians. You can also monitor backing status on the [Collateralization Dashboard](https://dashboard.m0.org/stablecoins/mantrausd).

### How do I burn mantraUSD?

You can burn mantraUSD to redeem the underlying collateral managed by M0. Redemptions follow T+2 settlement timelines (consistent with U.S. Treasury market operations). Direct redemptions are available to authorized Minters meeting KYC/AML requirements. See the [Minting & Burning](/how-it-works/minting-burning) guide.

### What is the collateral backing mantraUSD?

### Who manages the collateral?

**M0 handles all collateralization** for mantraUSD. M0 is the leading stablecoin provider and the same building block used by several of the largest stablecoins (e.g., mUSD). M0 manages the U.S. Treasury Bills, validator attestations, and all collateral operations.
