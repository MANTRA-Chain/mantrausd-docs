## What is mantraUSD?

mantraUSD is an **ecosystem stablecoin** built on **M0's universal stablecoin platform**, designed to become the primary medium of exchange for tokenized Real World Assets (RWAs). As an extension of **$M** (M0's base stablecoin), mantraUSD inherits M0's security and operational framework while introducing targeted reward redistribution to ecosystem partners.

M0 is the same building block used by several of the largest stablecoins (e.g., mUSD), providing battle-tested infrastructure for collateral management. **All collateralization is handled by M0**, which manages the underlying U.S. Treasury Bills that fully back mantraUSD.

mantraUSD provides:

- **RWA Transactions**: Purpose-built settlement medium for tokenized Real World Assets
- **Value Storage**: Stable store of value backed by U.S. Treasury Bills
- **DeFi Integration**: Use in decentralized finance applications
- **Ecosystem Rewards**: Treasury yield distributed to partners who drive adoption
